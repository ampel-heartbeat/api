# CommandSocket - JS Core
A command-based WebSocket communication framework written in TypeScript/JavaScript.
##### A note about development progress...
The CommandSocket framework is functional, but nevertheless still in its infancy. While the basic functionality should work as documented, bugs are still likely.

## Related Packages
There are three other TypeScript/JavaScript CommandSocket packages that you are most likely looking for:
1. CommandSocket Server [[GitHub]](https://github.com/command-socket/cs-js-server) [[NPM]](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@command-socket/server)
    - A centralized server which can spin up individual CommandSockets in connection with any number of clients.
2. CommandSocket Browser Client [[GitHub]](https://github.com/command-socket/cs-js-browser-client) [[NPM]](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@command-socket/browser-client)
    - A CommandSocket client that can be used in the browser.
3. CommandSocket Node Client [[GitHub]](https://github.com/command-socket/cs-js-node-client) [[NPM]](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@command-socket/node-client)
    - A CommandSocket client that can be used in a NodeJS environment.
Each of these packages provides a specific part of the total framework of the CommandSocket system.
## Basic Usage
Begin by spinning up a CommandSocket server (see [_Related Packages_](#related-packages) if you are unsure where to find this).
typescript
### SERVER SIDE
```typescript
import { CommandSocketServer } from "@command-socket/server";
let serverPort: number = 3849;
let server: CommandSocketServer = new CommandSocketServer(serverPort);
```
Then, in your choice of environment, create a client and point it to the location of the server that you've just started. Don't worry about which environment you're starting the client in (browser or NodeJS), both implementations expose the exact same functionality.
typescript
### CLIENT SIDE
```typescript
import { CommandSocket } from "@command-socket/browser-client";
// OR
import { CommandSocket } from "@command-socket/node-client";
const serverPort: number = 3849;
const serverIP: string = "4.3.2.1";
const wsAddress: string = "ws://" + serverIP + ":" + serverPort;
let client: CommandSocket = new CommandSocket(wsAddress);
```
And voilÃ ! You have a connected server-client pair!
The client also exposes `on open` and `on close` events, so you can also perform any desired action when such an event occurs, for example: logging it to the console.

### CLIENT SIDE
```typescript
client.getEvents().OPEN.subscribe(() => console.log("Socket successfully connected!"));
client.getEvents().CLOSE.subscribe(() => console.log("Socket closed."));
```
After all is said and done, remember to close the server when you are done with it.

### SERVER SIDE
```typescript
server.close();
```
